### Questions:

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
   Leads to more modularized, flexible & extensible code. Gives organizations the ability to painlessly update their software to address new business requirements or other unforeseen variables. Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.

1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
   It necessitates a lot of time and effort up front, which can make development feel slow to begin with.

1. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

1) Name a use case for a static method

1) Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves

### Terms to know:

- functional programming - the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Immutability is a central concept of functional programming because without it, the data flow in your program is lossy. Keep function and data separate.

- pure function - when given the same inputs, alwasy returns the same output and has no side effects

- higher-order function - any function which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both

- immutable state

- object

- object-oriented programming (OOP) - application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.
- class

- prototype

- super

- inheritance

- constructor

- instance

- context -

- this

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. Automated unit tests are written before the code is actually written. Running these tests give you fast confirmation of whether your code behaves as it should or not.

- Jest

- Continuous Integration (CI)

- unit test
