## Read 18: Socket.io

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
1. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
1. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
1. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
1. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

### Vocabulary Terms

- OSI Model - (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. Split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
- TCP Model - describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. Application layer, transport layer, internet layer, network access layer
- TCP - (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.
- UDP - (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
- Packets - a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data) being transferred.
- Socket - A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an application programming interface (API) for the networking architecture. Sockets are created only during the lifetime of a process of an application running in the node.
