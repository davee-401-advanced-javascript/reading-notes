## Random Notes on Server

- touch server.js
- npm init -y (creates package.json file)
- server.js will run on our machine 
- the command "node" will run js files in the terminal
- the command "npm" will look into package.json > script> and run whatever js file you choose

- will use express(node application library)
- node allows us to run js files
- npm is used to install javascript dependencies(can be found in package.json file)
- use npm to install express(when express is installed node_modules is created)

`const express = require('express');` is how we link js files from package.json into a server js file.
